# Project-3

Project 3 by Chris Bryant, Lauren Tayara, Brian Withrow, Shana Zaman, and Brandon Srinath


### *Project Research Question*
How can we improve internal Finance Department approval processes?


### *Background*
The public often criticizes government as being inefficient and technologically outdated. This project seeks to improve internal financial processes in not only government but also to apply in other private industries. Capital projects in government are large projects usually over 100,000 dollars that often require upkeep. Governments do not take these projects lightly and often reuire years of planning, approvals, and multiple phases to complete. In this project we with use "Wales High School" as our example. 


### *Phase I*
The first part of the project addresses the inefficiencies in processes in government finance offices. We created a contract to simplify processes in a government finance office when large capital projects are concerned. Using the concept of voting, we apply Solidity to mimic an approval process. Since members from mulitple levels of government (i.e Board, Management, Finance, etc) need to physically sign on paper for approval of a certain capital project, it often slows down the process. This also ensures a unanimous agreement on the capital project. We are eliminating the need for physical signatures and making the process more secure and efficient. 

#### *Tech Used and Process*
Truffle - petshop, Truffle, Ganache, Javascript, Node JS, HTML, Solidity


### *Phase II*
In this phase of the project we added a level for dividing the money required to complete the capital project. Another eliminated inefficiency, 
Ideally, this phase would connect with a governments financial software.


#### Tech Used and Process
Remix Solidity Splitter function
Ganache


Both phases of this project are not necessarily tied to government and could be used in Finance Offices in other private industries to increase accuracy, productivity, and efficiency.



### *Implications*
Use in other industries

Gas limits and cost - is it worth it?

larger scale? multiple votes from same person
